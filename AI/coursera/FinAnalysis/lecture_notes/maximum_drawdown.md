- Key takeaways:
    - Maximum drawdown (MDD) is a measure of an asset's largest price drop from a peak to a trough.
    - Maximum drawdown is considered to be an indicator of downside risk, with large MDDs suggesting that down movements could be volatile.
    - While MDD measures the largest loss, it does not account for the frequency of losses, not the size of any gains.

- Maximum Drawdown (MDD) - is the maximum observed loss from a peak to a trough of a portfolio, **before a new peak is attained**.
    - Maximum drawdown is an indicator of downside risk over a specified time period.
    - It can be used both as a stand-alone measure or as an input into other metrics such as "Return over Maximum Drawdown" and the Calmar Ratio. 
    - We use maximum drawdown as one of the key statistics for evaluating our quantitative investment strategies and for deciding on the introduction of new variables in our models.

- Definition 2: Max drawdown is an indicator of the risk of a portfolio chosen based on a certain strategy

- Maximum Drawdown is expressed in percentage terms.
    - If an investment never lost a penny, the maximum drawdown would be zero.
    - The worst possible maximum drawdown would be 100%, meaning the investment is completely worthless.

- it only measures the size of the largest loss, without taking into consideration the frequency of large losses
    - Because it measures only the largest drawdown, MDD does not indicate how long it took an investor to recover from the loss, or if the investment even recovered at all.

- MDD should be used in the right perspective to derive the maximum benefit from it.
    - In this regard, particular attention should be paid to the time period being considered.

- Example:
    - Assume an investment portfolio has an initial value of $500,000.
    The portfolio increases to $750,000 over a period of time, before plunging to $400,000 in a ferocious bear market.
    It then rebounds to $600,000, before dropping again to $350,000.
    Subsequently, it more than doubles to $800,000. What is the maximum drawdown?
        - The maximum drawdown in this case is = ($350,000 – 750,000) / $750,000 = –53.33%
        - Note: The initial peak of $750,000 is used in the MDD calculation. The interim peak of $600,000 is not used, since it does not represent a new high. The new peak of $800,000 is also not used since the original drawdown began from the $750,000 peak.
        - The MDD calculation takes into consideration the lowest portfolio value ($350,000 in this case) before a new peak is made, and not just the first drop to $400,000.
