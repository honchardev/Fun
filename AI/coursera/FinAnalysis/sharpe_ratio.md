- Key takeaways:
    - The Sharpe ratio adjusts a portfolio’s past performance—or expected future performance—for the excess risk that was taken by the investor.
    - A high Sharpe ratio is good when compared to similar portfolios or funds with lower returns.
    - The Sharpe ratio has several weaknesses including an assumption that investment returns are normally distributed.

- Sharpe ratio is used to help investors understand the return of an investment compared to its risk.
    - The ratio is the average return earned in excess of the risk-free rate per unit of volatility or total risk.

- Generally, the greater the value of the Sharpe ratio, the more attractive the risk-adjusted return.
    - A portfolio with a higher Sharpe ratio is considered superior relative to its peers

- The Sharpe ratio is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate from the return of the portfolio and dividing that result by the standard deviation of the portfolio’s excess return.
    - Subtracting the risk-free rate from the mean return allows an investor to better isolate the profits associated with risk-taking activities

- Main purpose:
    - calculating the risk-adjusted return.
    - evaluate a portfolio’s past performance (ex-post) where actual returns are used in the formula
    - help explain whether a portfolio's excess returns are due to smart investment decisions or a result of too much risk
    - The greater a portfolio's Sharpe ratio, the better its risk-adjusted performance

- Limitations of using sharpe ratio:
    - The Sharpe ratio uses the standard deviation of returns in the denominator as its proxy of total portfolio risk, which assumes that returns are **normally distributed**.
        - However, returns in the financial markets are skewed away from the average because of a large number of surprising drops or spikes in prices.
        - Additionally, the standard deviation assumes that price movements in either direction are equally risky.
            - For asymmetrical return distribution with a Skewness greater or lesser than zero and Kurtosis greater or lesser than 3, the Sharpe ratio may not be a good measure of performance.
                - Measures like Sortino, which only considers negative deviation from the mean return, can remove the limitation of Sharpe ratio to some extent.
    - Misinterpreting data / faking data:
        - The Sharpe ratio can be manipulated by portfolio managers seeking to boost their apparent risk-adjusted returns history
        - Choosing a period for the analysis with the best potential Sharpe ratio, rather than a neutral look-back period, is another way to cherry-pick the data that will distort the risk-adjusted returns.
    - The Sharpe ratio is a relative measure of risk-adjusted return. If considered in isolation, it does not provide much information about the fund’s performance. 

- Example:
    - The Sharpe ratio is often used to compare the change in overall risk-return characteristics when a new asset or asset class is added to a portfolio
        - Result: Here, the investor has shown that although the hedge fund investment is lowering the absolute return of the portfolio, it has improved its performance on a risk-adjusted basis
