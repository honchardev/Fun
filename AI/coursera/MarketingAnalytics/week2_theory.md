# Measuring brand value
- Interbrand Valuation Model - one of the famous brand valuation models
    - Interbrand - name of one of the consulting companies, which publishes rankings of the most valuable brands.
- How Interbrand values brand (in USD):
    - Financial Analysis
    - Market Analysis
    - Brand Analysis
- Market Analysis and Brand Analysis == surveys of consumers
- Financial Analysis == companies balance sheet
- Financial Analysis:
    - residual eranings & forecasts
    - brand earnings - current value of the brand
- Market Analysis:
    - role of branding - how strong is the brand going to be in the future
- Brand Analysis
    - Brand Strength Score: how strong is brand's connection with consumers == surveys
    - Risk Rate - how volatile is this relationship that a consumer has with a brand will be in the future
- Brand Earnings + Risk Rate = Brand Value
- Brand earnings - something at the moment; Risk rate - something in the future.

- Several valuable brands according to Interbrand (2014):
    - Apple: 118863 $Millions; Percent Growth: 21
    - Google: 107439 $Millions; PG: 15
    - Coca Cola: 81564 $Millions; PG: 3

- Young and Rubicam (Y & R) brand asset valuator
    - is totally based on consumer surveys
    - 4 main elements:
        - differentiation: how different is the brand compared to it's competitors set
            - == the brand's point of difference
        - relevant: how relevant is it today to the consumer
            - how appropriate the brand is to you
        - Esteem: how well regarded the brand is
        - Knowledge: an intimate understanding of the brand
    - Differentiation + Relevance = Brand Strength (Strength / Vitality)
    - Esteem + Knowledge = Brand Stature (Emotional Capital)
    - Brand Strength + Emotional Capital = FINAL SCORE

- Conclusions:
    - Interbrand valuation model - financial value
    - Y&R - what the value means in terms of relationship with the consumers and gives good diagnostics.

# Measuring Brand value: key points
- Brand Equity:
    - Provides a long term estimate of the value of a brand
    - Measures such as Interbrand and revenue premium provide a financial estimate
    - The Y&R measure provides a diagnostic estimate
- The value of knowing brand value:
    - Know the amount to pay for a company during mergers and acquisitions
    - Trade off marketing investment between long term brand value and short term price promotion pressures.

# Revenue premium as a Measure of Brand Equity
- Revenue premium:
    - basic idea: you're going to look at the premium of brand earns over a private label in the market place
    - it kind of combines the measures of Interbrand brand ranking and the Y&R brans asset valuator.
        - because it gives you both a financial value of the brand and some diagnostics
    - it is more suitable for brands that are in the grocery store: Colgate toothpaste for example.
- Main assumption of the revenue premium method: "Demand difference is based on brand name"
    - == branded and private label products are similar in all aspects except their brand names

- Revenue Premium that a brand earns in a market over a private label
- Assumptions:
    - Brands make optimal marketing decisions (in order to maximise their profits)\
    - Demands faced by a private label is equal to the demand faced by the branded product without the brand name
- Equity = (Revenue_premium - Additional_varialbe_cost) * (1 + d) / (1 + d - r)
    - (1+d)/(1+d-r) - long-term multiplier
    - d = discount rate
        - == amount of money i could've made without lending the dollar but investing it in the market or somewhere else
        - == return over a year is about 10% on the dollar == that is the discount rate
    - r - stability factor
        - portion of equity retained from period to period
        - how stable is down the road - risky/not
            - if the brand is very risky - you want your money from the brand today
    - if r goes up -> long-term multiplying term goes up
        - So equity is higher for stable brands and lower for risky brands

# Applying revenue premium measure to calculate the brand value for Snapple
- Annual Brand equity = Revenue Premium - Additional Variable Cost
- Step 1: get annual revenue premium / household
    - ((share*price_per_pound)_brand - (share*price_per_pound)_private_label) * consumption_household
- Step 2: get additional variable cost
    - Assume 20% margin for private label
        - Gross margin = 100-20 = 80%
    - (share_percentage_brand - share_percentage_priv_lbl) * (0.8) * (price_per_pound) * cons_per_household
- Step 3:
    - Assume 100M househoulds in the US
    - AnnualBrandEquity = (step1-step2) * 100M = $XX million

# Conclusion week 2:
- Brands are an extremely valuable asset
- Their value can be measured in many ways
- Tracking the value of brands over time allows firms to measure the impact of actions on brand value
- Analytics tells us how marketing is influencing brands and what is the value of the brand
