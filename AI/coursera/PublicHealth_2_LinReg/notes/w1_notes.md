# Uses of models in public health research
- Help to evaluate interventions to see if they work
    - example: in a clinical trial we might be interested in estimating the effect of a treatment, such as statin for heart disease
    - example 2: in an observational study, we may want to determine the effects of a certain exposure (air pollution) on asthma
- Our focus in models - to obtain an estimate for that treatment or exposure that's been adjusted for all other variables
- We can also use models to help us understand the cause of disease
    - what are the predictors for high blod pressure / depression / ... ?
        - Here we are interested in all regression estimates and their relationship with the outcome
- Models could be very useful tools for prediction - they provide us with a chance to intervene in order to avoid future adverse outcomes
- We can also use prediction models to help us diagnose patients
    - in diagnosis, one or more measurements are taken and the model is used to categorise the patient as either having or not having the disease
        - example: breath test to detect stomatch and esophageal cancer

- To sum up: model uses in public health:
    - evaluating intervention
    - understanding the disease
    - predicting future outcome

- The purpose of the model will inform important aspects of how we develop the model
    - Our approach to selecting variables / selecting accuracy will depend on whether we want to use the model for evaluating intervention / understanding the disease / predicting future outcome

- 'Evaluation' is when the focus is only on one particular variable, for example in a clinical trial we are only interested in estimating the intervention effect (in the primary hypothesis).
- Using linear regression to understand the causes of the disease means that you will be able to understand the relationship of all variables with the outcome.
