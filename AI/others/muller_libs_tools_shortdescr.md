# scikit-learn
Contains a number of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, as well as comprehensive documentation about each algorithm.
scikit-learn is built on top of the NumPy and SciPy scientific Python libraries.

# Anaconda
A Python distribution made for large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, and scientific computing. Anaconda comes with NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, pandas, IPython, Jupyter Notebook and scikit-learn.

# Jupyter Notebook
The Jupyter Notebook is an interactive environment for running code in the browser. It is a great tool for exploratory data analysis and is widely used by data scientists.

# NumPy
NumPy is one of the fundamental packages for scientific computing in Python. It contains functionality for multidimensional arrays, high-level mathematical functions such as linear algebra operations and the Fourier transform, and pseudorandom number generators.

# SciPy
SciPy is a collection of functions for scientific computing in Python. It provides, among other functionality, advanced linear algebra routines, mathematical function optimization, signal processing, special mathematical functions, and statistical distributions.
