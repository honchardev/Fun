>Obviously, weâ€™re rooting for PostgreSQL, but it is possible there are some scenarios in which MySQL best benefits the end-user.

# Open Source
PostgreSQL is free and open-source software. Developed by PostgreSQL Global Development Group.
MySQL is owned by Oracle Corporation and offers several paid editions for proprietary use.

# ACID Compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
PostgreSQL is ACID compliant from ground up and ensures that all requirements are met.
MySQL is only ACID compliant when using InnoDB and NDB Cluster Storage engines.

# SQL Compliance
PostgreSQL is largely SQL compliant.
MySQL is partially compliant on some of the versions (e.g does not support CHECK constraints).

# Replication
PostgreSQL supports Master-Standby replication and introduced signification enhancements so there is almost real-time replication and hot standby capabilities for standby servers.
Replications offered by PostgreSQL: single master to one standby; single master to multiple standbys; hot standby/streaming replication; bi-directional replication; logical log streaming replication; cascading replication.
MySQL supports Master-Standby replication.
Replications offered by MySQL: single master to one standby; single master to multiple standbys; single master to one standby to one or more standbys; circular replication (a-b-c and back to a); master to master.

# Performance
PostgreSQL is widely used in large systems where read and write speeds are crucial and data needs oto validated. In addition, it supports a variety of performance optimizations that are available only in commercial solutions.
Overall, PostgreSQL performance is utilized best in systems requiring execution of complex queries.
PostgreSQL performs well on OLTP/OLAP systems when read/write speeds are required and extensive data analysis is needed.
PostgreSQL also works well with Business Intelligence applications but is better suited for Data Warehousing and data analysis applications that require fast read/write speeds.
MySQL is a widely chosen for web based projects that need a database simply for straightforward data transactions. It is common, though, for MySQL to underperform when strained by a heavy loads or when attempting to complete complex queries.
MySQL performs well in OLAP/OLTP systems when only read speeds are required.
MySQL + InnoDB provides very good read/write speesd for OLTP scenarios. Overall, MySQL performs well with high concurrency scenarios.
MySQL is reliable and works well with Business Intelligence applications, as bi applications are typically read-heavy.

# Security
PostgreSQL has ROLES and inherited roles to set and maintain permissions. PostgreSQL has native SSL support for connections to encrypt client/server communications. It also has Row Level Security.
In addition to this, PostgreSQL comes with a built-in SE-PostgreSQL which provides additional access controls based on SELinux security policy.
MySQL implements security based on Access Control Lists (ACLs) for all connections, queries, and other operations that a user may attempt to perform. There is also some support for SSL-encrypted connections between MySQL clients and servers.

# Cloud Hosting
PostgreSQL and MySQL are supported by all major cloud service providers, including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.

# Concurrency Support
PostgrSQL tackles concurrency efficiently with its MVCC implementation, which achieves very high levels of concurrency.
MySQL only has MVCC support in InnoDB.

# NoSQL featrures / JSON support
PostgreSQL supports JSON and other NoSQL features like native XML support and key-values pairs with HSTORE. It also supports indexing JSON data for faster access.
MySQL has JSON data type support but no other NoSQL feature. It does not support indexing for JSON.

# Materialized Views/Temporary Tables ('cache' for databases)
PostgreSQL supports materialized views and temporary tables.
MySQL supports temporary tables but does not support materialized views.

# Geospatial data support
PostgreSQL supports it via PostGIS extension.
In MySQL, geospatial data support is built in.

# Programming Languages Support
PostgreSQL supports a wide variety of PLs.
MySQL: there is some support for server side programming in a single language which is not extensible. New versions of MySQL (5.7+) also support some NoSQL features as well.

# Extensible Type System
PostgreSQL has several features dedicated to extensibility. It is possible to add new types, new functions, new index types, etc.
In MySQL, there is no support for extensibility.
