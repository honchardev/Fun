"""
The main "actors" in the OO paradigm are called objects.
Each object is an instance of a class.
The class definition specifies instance variables (data members) and methods (member functions).

OO design goals:
1. Robustness - correct software & capable of handling unexpected inputs.
2. Adaptability - software needs to be able to evolve over time in response to changing conditions in its environment.
3. Reusability - the same code should be usable as a component of different systems in various applications.

OO design principles:
1. Modularity - keeping in order interactions of several different components within entire system.
2. Abstraction - distill a complicated system down to its most fundamental parts.
3. Encapsulation - different components of a software system should not erveal the internal details of their respective implementations.

Design pattern - a thing that describes a solution to a "typical" software design problem. A pattern provides a general template for a solution that can be applied in many different situations.

Class - a class serves as the primary means for abstraction in OOP. Every piece of data is represented as an instance of some class.
